# 📄 AI Resume Screener using NLP

This is a simple yet powerful AI-driven web application that helps screen resumes against a job description using Natural Language Processing (NLP). It calculates a match score, highlights potential resume improvements, and supports batch upload of multiple PDFs.

## 🔍 Features

- 📤 Upload multiple resumes (PDFs)
- 🧠 NLP-based similarity matching using TF-IDF + Cosine Similarity
- 📌 Compares resumes against a provided Job Description
- 📊 Match score with progress bars and recommendations
- 🔎 Highlights potential missing keywords
- 🎨 Clean Streamlit UI with sidebar and enhancements

## 🚀 How it Works

1. **Upload resumes** (PDF format)
2. **Job description** is loaded from a `job_description.txt` file
3. App cleans and analyzes the text using NLP
4. Calculates a similarity score between each resume and the JD
5. Displays recommendations:
   - ✅ Strong Match (Score ≥ 70%)
   - ⚠️ Needs Improvement (Score < 70%)
6. Highlights missing keywords (basic rule-based logic)
